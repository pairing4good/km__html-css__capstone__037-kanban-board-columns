# 036 Kanban Board: Story Card

[![034 KanbanBoard](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lbUoW09NnXs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbUoW09NnXs)

Based on customer feedback, we are going to pivot the task list to a [kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) with three columns (todo, doing, done). This is a significant change. We will break this large change down into smaller stories to avoid breaking our product.

```
Given that tasks exist 
When they are displayed 
Then present them as story cards
```

Steps:
- The class card should have a solid, black outline
- The class card should have a 10px margin
- The class card should have a 3px, gray shadow
- The class card should be 175px wide
- The row class should be removed from the tasks in the HTML
- The row CSS declaration should be removed from the style element
